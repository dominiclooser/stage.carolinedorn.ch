<h2>Lectures &amp; Workshops</h2><p><img src="/images/small/frankpowers.jpg" alt="image alt title"></p>
<p>I have given lectures for diverse audiences in natural science and art. Here, I reveal the ones that were meant for the art &amp; design audience:</p>
<p>I gave my lecture &quot;Introduction to Life on Earth, Astrobiology &amp; the Diversity of Planets&quot; at ZHdK. The workshop &quot;Performance Stage - Performance Space: COSMIC SOUP / SPACE STAGE&quot; was done for the art performance class of HKB, and my workshop on &quot;Planetary Thinking&quot; was done for HyperWerk Basel.</p>
