<p>I am very thankful to the artist duo <em>hoelb/hoeb</em>. They are such an inspirational source for me. In 2016 and 2017, I had the pleasure to take part in two of their projects: <em>Training</em> and <em>LOST_INN</em>.</p>
<p><em>hoelb/hoeb</em> offer visitors surprising new perspective with their experimental arrangements and dare to elucidate our understandings of charity, care, and humanity. </p>
