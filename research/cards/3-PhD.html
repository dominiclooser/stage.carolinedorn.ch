<h2><a href="/research">Environmental Science &amp; Hydrogeophysics</a></h2><p>I developed a method to combine geophysical and hydrological data in order to characterize water aquifer systems. Groundwater management rely on quantitative aquifer models that capture the heterogeneity of hydraulic properties. Fractured aquifer systems are one of the most heterogeneous
types of aquifers and are very challenging to investigate. I prepared and co-lead two field campaigns, processed and analysed all data, improved the imaging of tracer movements in complex fractured systems, developed 3-D fracture modeling, and developed a stochastic generator of 3-D fracture networks that are conditioned to available hydrological and geophysical data. This work was conducted during my PhD and was awarded with the faculty prize.</p>
