<p>I developed a method to combine geophysical and hydrological data in order to characterize water aquifer systems.</p>
<p>Groundwater management rely on quantitative aquifer models. I prepared and co-lead two field campaigns, processed and analysed all data, improved the imaging of tracer movements in complex fractured systems, developed 3-D fracture modeling, and developed a stochastic generator of 3-D fracture networks that are conditioned to available hydrological and geophysical data. This work during my PhD and was awarded with the faculty prize.</p>
