<p>There is a hunger for knowing whether we are alone in the Universe. This curiosity drives the
exoplanet community to characterize planets outside our Solar system in order to get a picture
of other worlds. </p>
<p>Astronomers have made tremendous achievements to find and characterize exoplanets using a wide variety of methods. The complexity of exoplanet interior characterization demands interdisciplinary collaboration in order for the field to reach its potential role
in characterizing planets. My research advances the characterization of both individual planets and planet distributions.</p>
