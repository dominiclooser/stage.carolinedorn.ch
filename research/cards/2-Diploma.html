<h2><a href="/research">Geophysical Imaging</a></h2><p>I provided the first images of tectonically active structures in the northwest Canterbury plains, New Zealand. Earthquakes are common natural hazards in New Zealand, which is located on the collisional boundary between major tectonic plates, the Pacific and the Autralian plate. Earthquake risk assements require knowledge of subsurface geology. My study provided first images of active fault zones beneath a nearly featureless topography of northwest Canterbury. I was co-leader during the field campain in New Zealand, I processed and analysed the seismic and ground-penetrating radar data. This work was done in the framework of my Diploma thesis.</p>
