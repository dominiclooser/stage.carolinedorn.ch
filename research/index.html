exoplanet community to characterize planets outside our Solar system in order to get a picture
of other worlds. Astronomers have made tremendous achievements to find and characterize exoplanets using a wide variety of methods. The complexity of exoplanet interior characteri-
zation demands interdisciplinary collaboration in order for the field to reach its potential role
in characterizing planets. My research advances the characterization of both individual planets and planet distributions.</p>

</section><section class="card"><h2><a href="/research">Geophysical Imaging</a></h2><p>I provided the first images of tectonically active structures in the northwest Canterbury plains, New Zealand. Earthquakes are common natural hazards in New Zealand, which is located on the collisional boundary between major tectonic plates, the Pacific and the Autralian plate. Earthquake risk assements require knowledge of subsurface geology. My study provided first images of active fault zones beneath a nearly featureless topography of northwest Canterbury. I was co-leader during the field campain in New Zealand, I processed and analysed the seismic and ground-penetrating radar data. This work was done in the framework of my Diploma thesis.</p>
</section><section class="card"><h2><a href="/research">Environmental Science &amp; Hydrogeophysics</a></h2><p>I developed a method to combine geophysical and hydrological data in order to characterize water aquifer systems. Groundwater management rely on quantitative aquifer models that capture the heterogeneity of hydraulic properties. Fractured aquifer systems are one of the most heterogeneous
types of aquifers and are very challenging to investigate. I prepared and co-lead two field campaigns, processed and analysed all data, improved the imaging of tracer movements in complex fractured systems, developed 3-D fracture modeling, and developed a stochastic generator of 3-D fracture networks that are conditioned to available hydrological and geophysical data. This work was conducted during my PhD and was awarded with the faculty prize.</p>

<p>I have given lectures for diverse audiences in natural science and art. Here, I reveal the ones that address the natural science audience:</p>
<p>In summer 2019, I give a lecture during the Astrophysical Origins: Pathways from Star Formation to Habitable Planets Program at the Erwin Schroedinger Institute for Mathematics and Physics at the University of Vienna.</p>
